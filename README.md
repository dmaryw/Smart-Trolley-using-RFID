A Smart Trolley using RFID is an advanced shopping cart equipped with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to automatically detect, identify, and calculate the total bill of all items placed into (or removed from) the trolley in real time.

It replaces the traditional barcode scanning at checkout with automatic item recognition, which speeds up the billing process and improves the shopping experience.
